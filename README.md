# Git for Powercoders

*Usage:* This is your work sheet. Change it in any way you want (as long as you can answer the goals), 
**add any notes that help you personally** to remember tomorrow and also the days after tomorrow.

This is a [Markdown file](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) which many servers,
like GitHub too, format nicely as HTML.

## My Notes about Git


### Creating a repository

**Goal:** I know how to create a local Git repository.

What does Git do when initialising a local repository?

* It creates a ".git" directory with database
* Never delete ".git" directory


### Saving my changes

**Goal:** I can explain what “workspace”, “staging area”, and “local repository” are.

**Goal:** I can explain what a “commit” is.

I want to remember:

* *(New stuff you learned)*


### So, what did change?

**Goal:** I know how to show the current (workspace and staged) changes.

**Goal:** I can undo changes in the workspace and in the staging area.


### Adding features on branches

**Goal:** I understand when branches are used and how they are merged back.

**Goal:** I know how to find help about a command

I have the following branches:


### Some conflicts need resolving

**Goal:** I am able to resolve merge conflicts.

**Goal:** I can simplify the history by rebasing.


### Stash and Remote

**Goal:** I know how to temporarily undo my changes.

**Goal:** I can push my changes to a remote.


### When to commit/branch?

**Goal:** I know when it makes sense to create a commit or a branch.
